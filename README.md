# Advanced-Night-Sensing-Light-System: Hardware Design
Designed and implemented a Smart Nighttime Light Control System that utilizes advanced light-detection technology to identify nighttime conditions and activate a dynamic light-blinking pattern for enhanced visibility and safety.
As this is a Hardware project, All the steps including the whole procedure of the project is mentioned in the PDF file.

# Built by using:
* Sensor
* LED Light
* Wires
* Breadboard
* Battery
* Carbon resistor
* BC 547 Transistor
* Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
